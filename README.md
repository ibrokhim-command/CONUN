</p>


## Blockchain-based Distributed Supercomputing Platform
  CONUN is a platform that builds a horizontal distributed desktop computing   system integrated with blockchain technology that shares idle processing resources on personal computers to handle multiple projects that require high performance computing resources. CONUN uses Ethereum blockchain that transparently and securely exchanges transactions , agreements, and payments without any intermediary services.

"CONUN offers an efficient environment for computational speedup, expandability , availability , reliability, and above all, good price-performance benefits"

## Sample Project
#### Description
This sample project created to show how distributed processing is performed on the CONUN distributed supercomputing platform. The sample project is a program which is quickly find the encrypted key using the AES_CBC algorithm. However, our sample project can be handeled with a maximum of 256 PC providers.<br>
-	In this sample project, you need two objects for the task processor and data file.
-	You can download the related program from [github](https://github.com/CONUN-Global/CONUN/releases).
-	It is possible to test max 256 task processors in one project.
